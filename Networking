*Three-way hand-shake:
  When two devices want to establish a TCP connection, they go through a three-way handshake process:

* SYN: One device sends a signal to another saying, "Hey, let's talk!"
* SYN-ACK: The other device responds, saying, "Sure, let's talk! I got your message."
* ACK: The first device confirms, "Great, I got your response! Let's start talking."

* SYN (Synchronize): It's like saying "Hi, I want to tallk to you.
                  
* ACK (Acknowledgment): It's like saying "Got it, let's talk!" in response to someone's invitation to talk you sent.

Both SYN and ACK flags are transmission control protocal headers that helps establish safer communication between devices, these flags contin individual bits within the TCP header.  

Other TCP flags include:

* FIN (Finish): Signals the end of data transmission from one side of the connection.
* RST (Reset): Resets the connection abruptly, often due to an error or unexpected situation.
* PSH (Push): Requests immediate delivery of data to the receiving application.
* URG (Urgent): Indicates that the data within the segment is urgent and should be prioritized.

Economic Advantages of Google Cloudâ€™s Advanced Networking Services:

Work reliably: It should always be available and able to recover quickly from any issues.
Be fast: It should transmit data quickly, especially for things like video calls or large file transfers.
Grow easily: It should be able to handle more users or data as needed without slowing down.
Stay secure: It should protect against hackers and keep data safe.
Be easy to manage: It should be simple to set up, monitor, and fix if anything goes wrong.
Adapt to changes: It should be able to adjust to new technologies or ways of working without needing a complete overhaul.
Not cost too much: It should provide value for money and not require a huge budget to run.
---------------------------------
Network: Collection of connected divices that are connected to each other via physical or logical connection.
Fiber optic cable: Cable that transmits data in th form of light.
Internet: Vast empty space that consists of different networks.

Region: Geographical location where cloud providers have their data centers.
Zone: Isolated loaction in a region that have their own power and network.
POP(Point of Presence): connection point from internet to google's network.
On-prem: Data centers belonging to enterprise.

VPC(Virtual Private Cloud): logical representation of on-prem. In GCP it is global construct.
There are two modes of VPC in GCP:
  * Custom mode
  * Auto mode
Subnets: These are regional in GCP.
IP address: A unique set of numbers to identify a device in internet.
